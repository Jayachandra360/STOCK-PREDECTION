# Q-Learning Stock Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a Q-learning based stock prediction system that utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to make buy, sell, or hold decisions for a given stock symbol. It incorporates real-time data fetching, technical indicator calculation, sentiment analysis on news articles, and machine learning models for prediction.

## Features
- Fetches real-time stock data using Yahoo Finance API.
- Calculates various technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, and CMF.
- Utilizes sentiment analysis on news articles related to the stock symbol to determine market sentiment.
- Implements a Q-learning algorithm for reinforcement learning to predict optimal actions (BUY, SELL, HOLD) based on the current state.
- Trains and updates Q-values during market hours, considering both price movements and sentiment scores.
- Uses a Random Forest classifier for training the model and LSTM neural networks for deep learning-based predictions.
- Provides visualization of model performance using confusion matrices.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Make sure you have the necessary API keys (e.g., News API) and update them in the code where required.

4. Run the main script to start the prediction process:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Main script to run the stock prediction system.
- `q_learning.py`: Implementation of the Q-learning algorithm and reinforcement learning components.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing, model training, and sentiment analysis.

Summary of code:
The provided code implements a Q-learning-based stock prediction system using reinforcement learning techniques. Here's a summary of its key components and functionalities:

1. **QLearningStockPrediction Class**: This class encapsulates the Q-learning algorithm. It includes methods for initializing Q-values, choosing actions, updating Q-values, saving/loading Q-values, and making predictions.

2. **fetch_data Function**: Fetches historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API.

3. **add_technical_indicators Function**: Calculates various technical indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, CMF) from the stock price data.

4. **preprocess_data Function**: Prepares the data by adding technical indicators and handling missing values.

5. **calculate_reward Function**: Computes the reward based on the action taken and the change in stock price.

6. **build_model Function**: Constructs a deep learning model (LSTM) for stock prediction.

7. **fetch_news_sentiment Function**: Retrieves sentiment scores from news articles related to the stock symbol using a hypothetical API (e.g., News API).

8. **plot_confusion_matrix Function**: Visualizes the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

9. **calculate_reward_based_on_sentiment Function**: Assigns rewards based on sentiment polarity of news articles.

10. **is_usa_market_open Function**: Checks if the USA stock market is open based on current time.

11. **main Function**: Implements the main logic for training and making predictions during market hours. It continuously fetches real-time data, updates Q-values, and makes predictions using the Q-learning algorithm.
